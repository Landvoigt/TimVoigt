    <h1>About me</h1>
    <span class="description-text">Hello, my name is Tim and I am a Frontend Developer based in ZÃ¼rich. Over the past
        several years while coding in my free time I worked as a chef where I had a successful career in
        three different restaurants. Even though I loved the culinary arts, the tech geek in me couldn't resist. So I
        decided eventually to make a professional career out of this and studied web development at the Developer
        Akademie in Munich.</span>

        <span>I enjoy turning ideas into reality by injecting my own creativity, plan a project carefully and write a
            clean code. My past job experience has equipped me with strong teamwork skills. I also have a
            preference for collaborative work and am receptive to forward-thinking methods.</span>

            professionally. If you see a potential fit for your company, please reach out!</span>
